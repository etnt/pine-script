in my Tradingview setup.

## Inside Bars

Indicate bars where their high and low are inside a previous bar.

Inside bars show a period of consolidation in a market.
They often form following a strong move in a market,
as it ‘pauses’ to consolidate before making its next move.

However, they can also form at market turning points and
act as reversal signals from key support or resistance levels."
